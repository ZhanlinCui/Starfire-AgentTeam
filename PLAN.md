## Phase 12: Code Sandbox — PARTIAL

> MVP done (subprocess + Docker backends). Production backends not started.

- [x] `run_code` tool — `tools/sandbox.py`
- [x] Docker-in-Docker backend (MVP) — throwaway container with resource limits
- [ ] Firecracker backend (production) — MicroVM isolation, faster cold starts
- [ ] E2B backend (cloud) — cloud-hosted via E2B API
- [x] Sandbox config — `SandboxConfig` dataclass in config.py

---

## Phase 30: SaaS — Remote Workspaces & Cross-Network Federation — IN PROGRESS

**Goal:** let a Python agent running on a laptop in another city boot,
register, authenticate, accept A2A from its parent PM on the platform,
and appear on the canvas as a first-class workspace.

**Why now:** the self-hostable single-box model has landed; the next
meaningful expansion is letting orgs span machines and networks. This
is the step that turns Starfire from "Docker-compose on one box" into
a multi-tenant SaaS-shaped product.

**Design thesis:** ride the existing `runtime='external'` escape hatch.
Every Docker-touching handler already short-circuits when a workspace
is external. We don't need a parallel subsystem — we need to close
four small gaps and add per-workspace auth. See
[`docs/remote-workspaces-readiness.md`](docs/remote-workspaces-readiness.md)
for the full code audit.

### Shipping order (eight bounded steps, ~2 weeks to GA)

- [x] **30.1 Workspace auth tokens** — foundation; prevents spoofing.
  New `workspace_auth_tokens` table; `POST /registry/register` issues
  a token; middleware validates `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on
  `/registry/heartbeat`, `/registry/update-card`. Lazy bootstrap so
  in-flight workspaces upgrade gracefully. Transparent to local
  containers — provisioner carries the token through the existing env-var
  pattern. No feature flag.

- [x] **30.2 Secrets pull endpoint** — `GET /workspaces/:id/secrets/values`
  returns decrypted secrets JSON, gated by the 30.1 token. Local agents
  can use it too (removes env-at-create coupling for rotating secrets).

- [ ] **30.3 Plugin tarball download** — `GET /plugins/:name/download`
  returns a tarball; agent unpacks locally. Replaces Docker-exec plugin
  install for remote agents. Behind `REMOTE_PLUGIN_DOWNLOAD_ENABLED`.

- [x] **30.4 Workspace state polling** — `GET /workspaces/:id/state`
  returns `{status, paused, deleted_at, pending_events[]}` as a drop-in
  for the WebSocket feed remote agents can't reach. Behind
  `REMOTE_STATE_POLLING_ENABLED`.

- [x] **30.5 A2A proxy token validation** — the proxy enforces the caller's
  auth token on `POST /workspaces/:id/a2a`. Mutual auth between agents.

- [ ] **30.6 Direct sibling discovery + URL caching** — agents call
  `GET /registry/{parent_id}/peers` once, cache sibling URLs, call them
  directly for A2A. Resilient to brief platform outages.

- [x] **30.7 Poll-liveness for external runtime** — `LivenessChecker`
  interface in `registry/`; `PollLiveness` marks offline if no heartbeat
  in 90s. Docker checker becomes one implementation, poll-liveness
  another. Health sweep routes by runtime. Behind
  `REMOTE_LIVENESS_POLLING_ENABLED`.

- [x] **30.8 Remote-agent SDK + docs** — `sdk/python/starfire_agent/`
  thin client: register → pull secrets → run A2A loop → poll state →
  heartbeat. Working `examples/remote-agent/` a new user can run on a
  laptop. Remove the three feature flags. Remote workspaces become GA.

### Out of scope for Phase 30

- Mutual TLS / platform-identity verification from the agent side.
  Agent trusts any platform URL in its env. Defer until real multi-
  tenant deployment forces the question.
- Agent-to-agent mesh across NATs. Direct sibling calls only work when
  siblings are reachable from each other. Behind-NAT ↔ behind-NAT needs
  a relay — defer to Phase 31.
- Platform-managed persistent state for remote agents. Remote agents
  own their filesystem; platform never mounts.

### Success criteria

- `examples/remote-agent/` boots on a laptop disconnected from the
  platform's LAN, registers, receives a task from parent PM via A2A,
  returns a result, appears on the canvas.
- `tests/e2e/test_federation.sh` spawns a second platform instance +
  remote agent pointing at the first; both platforms see the agent as
  a workspace in the right state.
- Spoofing test: attempt to impersonate a workspace with a guessed ID
  but no token → 401.

## PR Workflow Rules

All PRs must follow this checklist:

1. **Branch**: Never push to main. Always create a feature/fix branch.
2. **Code Review**: Run `/code-review` skill and fix all issues before requesting merge.
3. **Tests**: All existing tests must pass. New features require new tests.
4. **Documentation**: Run `/update-docs` skill. Every PR must update:
   - `docs/edit-history/` session log
   - Relevant docs in `docs/` (API, architecture, frontend, etc.)
   - `CLAUDE.md` if routes, env vars, or commands changed
   - `PLAN.md` if the work completes a phase or adds new items
5. **E2E Test**: Rebuild, restart service, and manually verify before reporting done.
6. **QA Review**: QA Engineer reviews for edge cases, plan compliance, and documentation completeness before CEO merge approval.
7. **CEO Approval**: Only the CEO approves merges. Never merge without explicit approval.

## Ecosystem Awareness

Adjacent projects worth tracking (Holaboss, Hermes, gstack, …) are catalogued
in **[`docs/ecosystem-watch.md`](docs/ecosystem-watch.md)**. Skim quarterly,
add entries liberally, and when one of those projects ships something we
should react to, file a "Signals to react to" line in that doc and create a
Backlog entry below pointing at it. Agents doing research or strategy work
should read `docs/ecosystem-watch.md` first — it's the canonical starting
point for "what else is out there."

---

## Backlog (prioritized)

1. **Canvas: Org template import** — Phase 20.3 (deploy org from canvas UI)
2. **Canvas: Workspace search (Cmd+K)** — Phase 20.3 (quick find)
3. **Canvas: Batch operations** — Phase 20.3 (multi-select delete/restart)
4. **Sandbox: Firecracker/E2B backends** — Phase 12 (production isolation)
5. **NemoClaw adapter** — stub exists at `adapters/nemoclaw/`, no implementation yet
6. **Remote plugin registry** — install plugins from npm/git (currently local only)
7. **Agent git worktrees** — per-agent branches without full clone
8. **SDK follow-ups** — live tool-call visibility, cost telemetry, cancel UX, governance hooks
9. **Real webhook mode for channels** — Phase 27 candidate. Currently polling-only; webhook needs:
   - `mode: "webhook"|"polling"` config field
   - `PUBLIC_URL` env var
   - Platform calls `setWebhook` on channel create (with random `webhook_secret`), `deleteWebhook` on delete
   - Canvas toggle to enable webhook mode (only when PUBLIC_URL is set)
   - Polling works fine for ≤hundreds of bots; webhook needed at thousands+ scale or for serverless
10. **More channel adapters** — Slack (OAuth + Events API), Discord (Bot + Gateway), WhatsApp (Cloud API)
11. **Delegations list endpoint mismatch** — #64. `GET /workspaces/:id/delegations` returns `[]` while the agent's internal `check_delegation_status` shows active/completed delegations. One source of truth.
12. **YAML-configurable per-agent repo access** — #65. New `workspace_access: none|read_only|read_write` field in `org.yaml` + `:ro` bind-mount for research agents; eliminates the "PM couriers documents to reports" workaround.
13. **SDK executor swallows subprocess stderr** — #66. `workspace-template/claude_sdk_executor.py` surfaces only "Command failed with exit code 1 / Check stderr output for details" when the `claude` CLI crashes, making every failure opaque. Capture stderr, log at ERROR, include first ~1 KB in the A2A error response. **High priority** — blocked real debugging during PLAN.md coordination on 2026-04-12.
14. **Agent MCP client defaults to `localhost:8080`** — #67. Inside a workspace container, `localhost` is the container itself, not the platform — so `mcp__starfire__*` tools fail with "platform unreachable." Inject `STARFIRE_URL=${PLATFORM_URL}` into every container at provision time and change the MCP client default to `http://host.docker.internal:8080`. **High priority** — blocks agents from calling platform tools (e.g. PM couldn't restart its own reports).

## Future Work — Plugin Adaptor System

Landed (see `feat/plugin-adaptor-registry` and `feat/agentskills-compliance`):
per-runtime plugin adaptors, hybrid resolver (registry > plugin-shipped >
raw-drop), `AgentskillsAdaptor` covering rule+skill plugins for all
runtimes, `/plugins?runtime=` filter, `/workspaces/:id/plugins/available`
endpoint, `starfire-plugin` SDK, gemini org parity with starfire-dev,
and **full agentskills.io spec compliance** for all first-party skills
(installable in Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and ~35 other skill-compatible
tools — see `docs/plugins/agentskills-compat.md`).

Deferred, not blocking:

- **Upstream `runtime-adapters/` extension to agentskills.io spec** —
  once we've lived with our own per-runtime adapter model for ~month,
  propose it as a spec extension to `agentskills/agentskills` so other
  tools can share Starfire-authored adaptors.
- **Install-from-GitHub-URL flow** — `POST /plugins/install {git_url}` that
  clones a repo into the registry, validates the manifest, and runs the
  adaptor through a sandbox. Needs signature/version pinning and a review
  of the adaptor-execution threat model before shipping.
- **Promote-to-default UI** — today, promoting a community plugin to
  "curated" means manually copying its `adapters/<runtime>.py` into
  `workspace-template/plugins_registry/<plugin>/`. Later add a canvas
  button + PR template that opens an upstream PR automatically.
- **Plugin packs** — manifest that lists other plugins to bundle
  (`superpowers-pack` → install `superpowers-tdd` + `superpowers-debug` + …).
  Skip until a real user asks; first-party plugins are small enough to
  install individually today.
- **Hot-reload on DeepAgents** — upstream docs say skills/sub-agents are
  startup-only; would need platform-level container restart on plugin
  file change. Defer until users complain.
- **Atomic split of first-party plugins** — `superpowers` and `ecc` still
  ship as multi-skill bundles. Pipeline already supports splitting but
  non-urgent.
- **Sub-agent plugins for non-DeepAgents runtimes** — Claude Code /
  LangGraph don't have a native sub-agent feature; emulating via
  tool-routing is possible but invasive. Defer.
- **Workspace install tracking table** — a `workspace_plugin_installs`
  table would let uninstall call the adaptor's `uninstall()` path
  reliably. Today uninstall is a `rm -rf /configs/plugins/<name>` which
  leaves copied skill dirs behind. Low user impact.
- **Shared org-template `system-prompt.md` via `_shared/`** — DRY starfire-dev
  and starfire-worker-gemini. Drift risk; revisit at 3+ orgs.
