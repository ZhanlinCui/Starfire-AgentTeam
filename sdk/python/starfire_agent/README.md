# starfire_agent — Remote-agent SDK for Starfire

Build a Python agent that runs **outside** a Starfire platform's Docker network
and registers as a first-class workspace. The agent gets bearer-token auth,
pulls its secrets, calls siblings, installs plugins from the platform's
registry, and reacts to platform-initiated lifecycle events (pause, delete) —
all over plain HTTP.

This is the client side of [Phase 30](../../../PLAN.md). The platform side
ships in the same release; this package is just the SDK an agent author
imports.

## Install

```bash
pip install starfire-sdk     # ships starfire_plugin + starfire_agent
```

## 60-second example

```python
from starfire_agent import RemoteAgentClient

client = RemoteAgentClient(
    workspace_id="<the-uuid-of-an-external-workspace-on-the-platform>",
    platform_url="https://your-platform.example.com",
    agent_card={"name": "my-remote-agent", "skills": []},
)

# 1. Register and mint a bearer token (cached at ~/.starfire/<id>/.auth_token).
client.register()

# 2. Pull secrets the platform was set to inject.
secrets = client.pull_secrets()
# → {"OPENAI_API_KEY": "...", ...}

# 3. (Optional) install a plugin locally — pulls a tarball, unpacks, runs setup.sh.
client.install_plugin("starfire-dev")
client.install_plugin("my-plugin", source="github://acme/my-plugin")

# 4. Run the heartbeat + state-poll loop until the platform pauses/deletes us.
terminal = client.run_heartbeat_loop()
print(f"loop exited: {terminal}")
```

A runnable demo with full setup walkthrough lives at
[`examples/remote-agent/`](../../../examples/remote-agent).

## What the SDK gives you

| Method | Phase | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `register()` | 30.1 | Mint + cache the workspace's bearer token |
| `pull_secrets()` | 30.2 | Token-gated GET of merged secrets dict |
| `install_plugin(name, source=None)` | 30.3 | Stream plugin tarball, atomic extract, run setup.sh |
| `poll_state()` | 30.4 | Lightweight `{status, paused, deleted}` poll |
| `heartbeat(...)` | 30.1 | Single bearer-authed heartbeat |
| `get_peers()` / `discover_peer()` | 30.6 | Sibling URL discovery with TTL cache |
| `call_peer(target, message)` | 30.6 | Direct A2A with proxy fallback |
| `run_heartbeat_loop()` | combo | Drives heartbeat + state-poll on a timer; exits on pause/delete |

## What it doesn't do (yet)

- **No inbound A2A server.** Other agents can't initiate calls to your remote
  agent unless you host an HTTP endpoint yourself. Future `start_a2a_server()`
  helper will close this gap.
- **No automatic reconnect after token loss.** If `~/.starfire/<id>/.auth_token`
  is deleted, you'll need to re-issue the token via the platform admin (since
  `POST /registry/register` is idempotent — it won't mint a second token for
  a workspace that already has one).

## Design choices

- **Blocking (`requests`), not async.** Drops into any runtime — script,
  thread, asyncio loop. No framework lock-in.
- **Token cached on disk with 0600** so a restart of the agent doesn't
  re-issue (the platform refuses anyway). Lives at
  `~/.starfire/<workspace_id>/.auth_token`.
- **URL cache for siblings is process-memory only**, 5-minute TTL. Cleared
  on graceful failures via `invalidate_peer_url`.
- **Tar extraction uses `_safe_extract_tar`** that rejects path-traversal
  and skips symlinks — defense against tar-slip CVEs in case a plugin
  source is compromised.

## Compatibility

Requires a Starfire platform with Phase 30 endpoints (PR #122 onwards).
Older platforms grandfather pre-token workspaces through, so this SDK
also works against a transition-period deployment — but you won't get
the security benefits of bearer auth until both sides upgrade.
